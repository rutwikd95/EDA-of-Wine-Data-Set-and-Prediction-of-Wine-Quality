# EDA-of-Wine-Data-Set-and-Prediction-of-Wine-Quality

This project consists of Exploratory Data Analysis of Wine Dataset. The processed data and its information is used to build or train models that can classify the wines in terms of “Good” or “Bad” based on the different features used in training the model. Using Random Forest and Support Vector Classifiers, classification of wine is done to predict the quality of wine. A comparative study of both the algorithms is done to find out which algorithm gives more accurate results and using Grid Search Cross Validation, accuracy of both the algorithms is improved.
